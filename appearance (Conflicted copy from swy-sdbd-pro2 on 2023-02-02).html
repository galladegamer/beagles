				<h1>APPEARANCE</h1>
				<br>
				<p class="image">

				</p>
				<p>The general appearance of the Beagle resembles a miniature Foxhound, but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body. They are generally between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41 cm) high at the withers and weigh between 18 and 35 lb (8.2 and 15.9 kg), with females being slightly smaller than males on average. </p>
				<br>
				<p>They have a smooth, somewhat domed skull with a medium-length, square-cut muzzle and a <sec class="black2">black</sec> (or occasionally <sec class="liver">liver</sec>) gumdrop nose. The jaw is strong, the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth, and both sets aligned square to the jaw. The eyes are large, <sec class="brown">hazel</sec> or <sec class="black">brown</sec>, with a mild hound-like pleading look. The large ears are long, soft and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips. Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a dewlap; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered abdomen and waist and a long, slightly curved tail (known as the "stern") tipped with <sec class="white2">white</sec>. The <sec class="white2">white</sec> tip, known as the flag has been selectively bred for, as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent. The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active. The Beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the stifles.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The <sec class="tri1">t</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec>-colored Beagle—<sec class="tri1">white</sec> with large <sec class="tri2">black</sec> areas and <sec class="tri3">light brown</sec> shading—is the most common. <sec class="tri1">T</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec>-colored Beagles occur in a number of shades, from the "Classic <sec class="tri1">T</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec> with a jet black saddle (also known as "Blackback"), to the "Dark <sec class="tri1">T</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec> (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings), to the "Faded <sec class="tri1">T</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec> (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings). Some <sec class="tri1">t</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec>colored dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as pied. These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair. <sec class="tri1">T</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec>color Beagles are usually born black and white. The white areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures. (The brown may take between one and two years to fully develop.) Some Beagles gradually change color during their lives, and may lose their black markings entirely.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Two-color varieties always have a <sec class="white2">white</sec> base color with areas of the second color. <sec class="tan2">Tan</sec> and <sec class="white2">white</sec> is the most common two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including <sec class="lemon">lemon</sec>, a very light tan; <sec class="red">red</sec>, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and <sec class="liver">liver</sec>, a darker brown, and black. <sec class="liver">Liver</sec> is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with <sec class="lemon">yellow</sec> eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either <sec class="white2">white</sec> or <sec class="black2">black</sec> with different colored flecks (ticking), such as the <sec class="blue2">blue</sec>-mottled or <sec class="blue2">blue</sec>tick Beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight <sec class="blue2">blue</sec> color, similar to the coloring of the <sec class="blue2">Blue</sec>tick Coonhound. Some <sec class="tri1">t</sec><sec class="tri2">r</sec><sec class="tri3">i</sec>color Beagles also have ticking of various colors in their <sec class="white2">white</sec> areas.</p>
